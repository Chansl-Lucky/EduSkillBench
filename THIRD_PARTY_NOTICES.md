# Third-Party Notices

EduSkillBench includes selected educational Agent Skills originating from third-party open-source projects.

The educational Skills and related materials from this project are distributed under the **Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0)** license.

Original authorship and copyright remain with the upstream project and its contributors.

## EduBench

EduSkillBench uses the educational scenario taxonomy and benchmark construction methodology of:

EduBench is released under the MIT License.

EduSkillBench is an independent benchmark project and is not an official extension of EduBench.

## edu_scene_66 — extended task set (263 tasks)

The extended single-turn task set under `data/single_turn_tasks_cn263.csv`,
`data/single_turn_tasks_cn263_trace.csv`, and `skills/single_turn_cn263/` consists of
English translations and restructurings of Chinese teaching-case documents sourced from:

`edu_scene_66` (commit `467fcaf`)

The snapshot used for conversion contained **no LICENSE or README file**, so the
redistribution terms of the upstream materials could not be verified. These tasks are
included for research and reproducibility. If you hold the rights to this material and
object to its inclusion, please open an issue and it will be removed.

Contributor names have been replaced with anonymous labels (`作者A`–`作者E`) in the
released traceability file. That historical anonymization statement did not cover all fields: subsequent review found name-like strings in shared contexts. The v3 candidate removes those shared contexts; local source bindings retain original source excerpts for traceability and are not an anonymized public release.

The 263 tasks are mapped onto the nine existing single-turn Skills; no new Skill was
created for them, and the Skills themselves are unchanged.

## Licensing Scope

Third-party Skills contained under `skills/` are **not relicensed by EduSkillBench**.

Their respective upstream licenses continue to apply.

Benchmark-specific code, generated task specifications, mappings, evaluation scripts, and result files should be treated separately from the licenses governing redistributed third-party Skill content.
