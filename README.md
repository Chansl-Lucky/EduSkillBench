# EduSkillBench

**EduSkillBench** is a benchmark for evaluating whether reusable educational agent Skills improve the performance of large language models on realistic education tasks.

The benchmark collects publicly available education-oriented Agent Skills, maps them to educational scenarios inspired by EduBench, constructs Skill-aligned tasks and rubrics, and compares **With-Skill** against **No-Skill** execution.

## Qwen3-4B GRPO Experiment: Teacher-facing Summary

For a concise Chinese report covering the conclusion, frozen configuration, three experimental
conditions, limitations, and reproduction entry points, see:

**[给老师的 Qwen3-4B Skill-GRPO 实验汇报](docs/TEACHER_REPORT_ZH.md)**

| Condition | Mean reward |
|---|---:|
| Base / No-Skill | 0.6435 |
| Base / With-Skill | 0.9063 |
| GRPO / With-Skill | 0.9388 |

Matched Skill injection contributes **+0.2628** and GRPO contributes a further **+0.0325**. The
GRPO paired bootstrap 95% interval is `[-0.0048, 0.0714]`; this is a positive point estimate, not
yet a statistically stable positive effect.

## Overview

EduSkillBench v1 contains:

* **18 education-oriented Agent Skills**
* **54 benchmark tasks**
* **14 single-turn Skills / 42 single-turn tasks**
* **4 multi-turn Skills / 12 multi-turn tasks**
* Coverage of **6 EduBench educational scenario categories**

The Skills are collected from existing open-source educational Skill repositories rather than newly invented for this benchmark.

## Skill Collection

Skills were collected from two public repositories:

* `GarethManning/education-agent-skills`
* `YujxZJCN/teaching-skills`

After filtering for relevance, executability, and compatibility with educational benchmark scenarios, **18 Skills** were retained.

The mapping between Skills and EduBench-inspired educational scenarios is provided in:

```text
data/skill_mapping.csv
```

EduSkillBench v1 currently covers six educational scenario categories. No artificial Skills were created solely to fill uncovered categories.

## Tasks

### Single-turn

The single-turn benchmark contains:

```text
14 Skills × 3 tasks = 42 tasks
```

The released tasks are available at:

```text
data/single_turn_tasks.csv
```

### Multi-turn

The multi-turn portion contains:

```text
4 Skills × 3 tasks = 12 tasks
```

The released tasks are available at:

```text
data/multi_turn_tasks.csv
```

The multi-turn tasks are included in the benchmark release but are **not part of the main v1 empirical evaluation**, because they require a dedicated learner-agent multi-turn execution protocol.

## Experimental Setup

The current v1 evaluation uses:

* **Models:** glm-5.3, glm-5.3-flash, deepseek-v4-pro, deepseek-v4-flash, and qwen3.7-plus
* **Agent:** OpenCode
* **Evaluation framework:** BenchFlow
* **Execution:** Docker sandbox
* **Comparison:** With-Skill vs. No-Skill

BenchFlow compatibility adjustments used in our environment are documented in:

```text
code/utils/patch_benchflow.sh
```

## Results

The main v1 experiment evaluates all 42 single-turn tasks under both With-Skill and No-Skill conditions, for each of five models:

```text
5 models × 42 tasks × 2 settings = 420 runs
```

All runs completed successfully (84/84 per model).

| Model            | With-Skill | No-Skill | Lift  |
| ---------------- | ---------- | -------- | ----- |
| deepseek-v4-flash | 0.533     | 0.314    | +0.219 |
| deepseek-v4-pro  | 0.963      | 0.825    | +0.137 |
| glm-5.3          | 0.905      | 0.714    | +0.190 |
| glm-5.3-flash    | 0.952      | 0.756    | +0.196 |
| qwen3.7-plus     | 0.948      | 0.767    | +0.180 |

Lift is the mean over the 14 Skills of the per-Skill With-Skill minus No-Skill difference. Skill augmentation improves mean reward for **all five models**, by **+13.7 to +21.9 percentage points** depending on the model.

Across the 14 evaluated Skills, the number showing positive lift ranges from **8/14** (deepseek-v4-flash) to **11/14** (deepseek-v4-pro and glm-5.3-flash). Each model has exactly one negative Skill: `lesson-builder` for four of the five models and `hinge-question-designer` for qwen3.7-plus. Several Skills sit at ceiling-level baseline performance and therefore show zero lift.

Detailed per-model, per-Skill results are available in:

```text
results/model_overall_summary.csv
results/model_overall_summary.json
results/model_skill_summary.csv
```

## Qwen3-4B Skill-Conditioned GRPO Extension

The repository also contains a reproducible three-stage small-model experiment:

```text
Qwen3-4B Base / No-Skill
Qwen3-4B Base / With-Skill
Qwen3-4B GRPO / With-Skill
```

The extension trains a LoRA policy for 70 GRPO steps over all 14 single-turn Skills, using 70
independent training prompts and DeepSeek-V4-Flash as the frozen rubric Judge. On the 42 official
tasks, Qwen3-4B Base / No-Skill scores 0.6435, Base / With-Skill scores 0.9063, and GRPO / With-Skill
scores 0.9388. Skill injection therefore adds +0.2628 over No-Skill, while GRPO adds a further
+0.0325 over Base / With-Skill. The GRPO paired bootstrap 95% interval is [-0.0048, 0.0714], so
that final increment is a positive point estimate rather than a statistically stable positive
effect.

See [the full configuration, commands, results, and limitations](docs/QWEN3_4B_SKILL_GRPO.md).
Compact machine-readable results are under `results/qwen3_4b_skill_grpo/`.

## Quick Start

### Requirements

The v1 experiments were conducted with:

* Python 3.12
* BenchFlow 0.6.7
* Docker
* OpenCode
* Access to the evaluated model endpoints: glm-5.3, glm-5.3-flash, deepseek-v4-pro, deepseek-v4-flash, and qwen3.7-plus

Make sure Docker is running and `bench` is available in your environment.

### Configure the model endpoint

API credentials must be provided through environment variables and must not be committed to the repository.

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
export OPENAI_BASE_URL="YOUR_OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_ENDPOINT"
```

If you use a standard provider configuration supported directly by BenchFlow, configure the corresponding environment variables instead.

### BenchFlow compatibility patch

Our experiments used BenchFlow 0.6.7 with an OpenAI-compatible endpoint and a non-OpenAI judge model.

For this configuration, apply the included compatibility patch:

```bash
bash code/utils/patch_benchflow.sh
```

The patch forwards the custom endpoint variables to the verifier and prevents the judge model from being replaced by the default OpenAI model.

### Run the single-turn benchmark

Run all 42 single-turn tasks under the released evaluation configuration:

```bash
bash code/evaluation/run_single_turn_v1.sh
```

The script evaluates the released Skills with:

* Agent: `opencode`
* Model: `qwen3.7-plus` (reference reproduction of the released qwen3.7-plus row)
* Sandbox: `docker`
* Concurrency: `1`

Runtime artifacts are written under `jobs/` and are intentionally excluded from version control.

### Aggregate results

`code/evaluation/summarize_single_turn_v1.py` is the **reference-model (qwen3.7-plus)** aggregator. It reads the completed run records under `jobs/` and writes runtime aggregates to `jobs/single-model-summary/`, which are git-ignored:

```bash
python code/evaluation/summarize_single_turn_v1.py
```

The released five-model leaderboard lives under `results/` (see [Results](#results)); the script above only reproduces the qwen3.7-plus row of that leaderboard.

### Task generation

The task-generation pipeline is provided under:

```text
code/generation/
```

The released benchmark tasks are already available under `data/`; regeneration is not required to reproduce the main evaluation.

### Multi-turn evaluation

The 12 multi-turn tasks and four associated Skills are included in the benchmark release, but the v1 empirical results cover only the 42 single-turn tasks.

A dedicated learner-agent multi-turn execution protocol is left for future work.

## Limitations

EduSkillBench v1 has several limitations.

First, only 14 Skills and 42 single-turn tasks are included in the main empirical evaluation.

Second, each Skill currently contains three evaluation cases, so Skill-level differences should not be interpreted as strong causal evidence.

Third, the 12 multi-turn tasks require a dedicated execution protocol and are released for future evaluation rather than included in the current main results.

Finally, Skill augmentation is not universally beneficial. The negative result observed for one Skill suggests that over-constraining instructions, task-Skill mismatch, or evaluation variance may reduce performance in some settings.

## Third-Party Skills

EduSkillBench redistributes selected third-party educational Agent Skills for benchmark reproducibility.

These Skills retain their original licenses and attribution. See:

```text
THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md
```

for details.

## Status

This repository contains the **EduSkillBench v1 benchmark release and single-turn evaluation results across five models**.

Multi-turn execution and larger-scale evaluation are planned as future extensions.
